Using the Path class:
- In Java 7 there's a new system for working with directories and files.
- The classes that are a part of the system are part of a package called "Java.nio",
  for new input-output.
- The core of this new system is a class called path that replaces the old file class.
- A path can represent either a directory or a file
Example: 22-PathClass project
