Watching a directory for file changes:
- Java 7's new Files API has a tool that lets you easily create a watch service,
  a service that watches the contents of a directory, and reports when any of the
  directory's contents are created, deleted, or modified.

- To watch the contents of the directory on disk, listen for events, and then take
  particular actions when those events occur. You can listen for the create, the
  delete, and modify events and handle a single directory in this way. And if you
  combine this code with say a directory walker, you can watch an entire directory
  tree for any files that are placed, deleted, or otherwise modified in that area of your hard disk.
