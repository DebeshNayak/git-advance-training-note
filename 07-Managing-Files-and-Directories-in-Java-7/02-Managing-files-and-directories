Managing files and directories:
- In Java 7, once you know how to use the Path class to point to a directory or a file,
  it's another simple step to start managing those files to be able to copy, delete, and
  move them around.
- To do this, you use a class called files, the second major part of this new package.
Example: 23-ManageFiles project
