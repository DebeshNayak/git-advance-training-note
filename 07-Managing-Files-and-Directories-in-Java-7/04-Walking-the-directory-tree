Walking the directory tree:
- Java 7 new files API gives you the ability to easily walk a directory tree, starting
  off at a parent directory and then examining all of its subfolders and subfolders of
  subfolders and so on, and all of the files within those folders.
- To implement this functionality, you create your own custom class that extends a class
  called "SimpleFileVisitor".
- As of now it may not be implemented in Android.
Example: 25-FileTree project
