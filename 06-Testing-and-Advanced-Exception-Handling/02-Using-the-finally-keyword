Using the finally keyword:
- The Try/catch block to wrap code that might throw an exception.
- Try and Catch work on their own for code where you don't need to clean up,
- But whenever you're using a resource that always needs be cleaned up, it's also a
  good idea to use the keyword Finally.
- A Finally block is code that executes after a try regardless of whether an exception
  is thrown.
- As long as the application is still running any code within the Finally block will be executed,
  and it's a good place to clean up resources that otherwise might remain open.
- By using a Finally Block with your Try/catch syntax, you can ensure that you're
  cleaning up resources correctly and handling exceptions wherever you need to in your code.
