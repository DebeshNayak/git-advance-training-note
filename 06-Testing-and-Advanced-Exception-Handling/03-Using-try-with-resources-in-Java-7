Using try with resources in Java 7:
- By using this new Try With Resources syntax you'll significantly reduce the amount of code
  it takes to clean up your resources after executing code that might throw an exception.
- Now again, this only works in Java 7 or later.
- If you're working in Android or in Java 6 or prior, you won't be able to use this syntax.
Example: 20-TryWithResources project
