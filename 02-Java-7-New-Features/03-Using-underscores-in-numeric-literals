Using underscores in numeric literals:
-------------------------------------
- The underscores are essentially ignored by the compiler.
- The compiler doesn't need those underscores to know that, that's a million,
  but adding them makes it easier for the human eye i.e. the programmers to look
  at and parse the value very quickly.
