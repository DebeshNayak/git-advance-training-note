using strings in switch statements:
- The switch statement lets you evaluate a variable and then branch your code depending
  on the variable's value.
- In Java 7, you can use switch to evaluate a string.
- Up through Java 6, it could only evaluate primitive variables, that is floats,
  longs, booleans, integers, and so on.
