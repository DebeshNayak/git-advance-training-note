Exploring the simplified use of generics:
- If we're using classes that use generic declarations such as ArrayList and many other collection classes,
  in Java 7, you only need to declare the data type of the contained objects once in the variable declaration.
- You don't have to re-declare it in the constructor method. It will save a little time in your coding and
  in the maintenance of your Java programs.
