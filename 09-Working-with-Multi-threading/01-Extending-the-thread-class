Extending the thread class:
- Multithreading is a process where you can have multiple things going on at the same time.
- When you setup multithreading, you are implementing what Java calls concurrency,
  concurrent operations that can execute simultaneously.
- When you run code within a single class, say within the Main class, the process is linear;
  only one thing can be executed at a time.
- But in order to create multiple threads, you can either create your new classes that extend a
  class called thread, or you can implement an interface.
- The Thread class is a member of the java.lang package, so no need to add special import
  statement for this
Example: 32-ExtendingThread project (extending the Thread class to create a secondary thread for Java
Application)
