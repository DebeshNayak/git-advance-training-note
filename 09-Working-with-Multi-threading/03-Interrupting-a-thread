Interrupting a thread:
- When you run a secondary thread, it will run to completion or until an exception
  occurs or when you explicitly interrupt it from the process that created it.
- Here we will explicit interruption in the project Interrupt Thread.
- The Main class finishes its execution, even after it calls the interrupt method
  and the thread only throws its exception after that.
- If you don't explicit interrupt then the thread execution carry on to completion
  unless another exception is thrown.
