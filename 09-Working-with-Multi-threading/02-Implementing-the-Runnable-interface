Implementing the runnable interface:
- There is another approach, creating a custom class that implements an interface called Runnable.
- When you implement the runnable interface, it will have the same run method as when you extend
  the Thread class as a super class.
- Implementing Runnable interface results in a slightly more lightweight class that only does the
  things you need instead of all the things that the Thread class does. But as you can see, it lets
  you define and executes secondary processes just as easily as extending the Thread class.
