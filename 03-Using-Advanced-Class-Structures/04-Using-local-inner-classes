Using local inner classes:
- A class that's defined within a code block, for example, a code block that's a
  part of the method definition and is only visible within that code block.
- We can define these local inner classes, whenever you want to define functionality
  it's only ever going to be called in this one location,
- It's a way of creating complex functionality, but keeping it hidden from the rest
  of the application.
