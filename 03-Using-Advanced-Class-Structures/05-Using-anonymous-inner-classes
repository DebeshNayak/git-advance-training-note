Using anonymous inner classes:
- An anonymous class doesn't have a name, it's defined and used exactly once.
- So if you want to work with inner classes, you can choose from
  - local inner classes, which have names,
  - or anonymous inner classes, which don't have names.
- Either way, you're defining class that's local to the current code block.
- The anonymous inner class is only be available within the code block in which it's defined.
