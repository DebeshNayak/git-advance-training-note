Using instance field initializers:
- Instance field initializer are used for initializing non-static fields
- Instance field initializer are a block of code without any keywords before the opening brace,
- And this code will be executed before any constructor methods
- It's especially handy where a class has more than one version of the constructor method,
  but you have a certain kind of code that you always want to execute, no matter which version
  of the constructor method is called.
Example: 06-InstanceFieldInitializer project
