Creating and using enumeration classes:
- EnumClasses is a special type of class that can be used to contain
  values that serve as constant.
- By using EnumClasses you can guarantee the correctness of your choices,
- you'll essentially localized the spelling of the options in a single class
- Then use those options everywhere else in the application.
-----------
- EnumClasses can make your application much more sturdy and easier to maintain
  in the long run, and as long as you know the trick for how to create private
  strings and private constructors, you can add as many fields and build in as many
  calculations into the construction of these options as you want to.

Example: 10-EnumClasses project
