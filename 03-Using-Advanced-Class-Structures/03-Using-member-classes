Using member classes:
- In the world of object-oriented programming we use the term encapsulation to talk about hiding data.
- In Java, you can hide data as private fields, but you can also create member classes that are contained
  within other classes and those member classes can be the ultimate sort of encapsulation.
-------------
- The advantage of member classes is that you can define classes that are available only within the containing
  class.
- In this case, I've made a decision that this class is only relevant and should only be callable from within the OliveJar.
- Whether you architect your code this way is completely up to you, but Java supports this very strong approach to
  encapsulation of both "data" and "functionality".
