Using static initializers:
-------------------------
- Static initializer is used to initialize complex static fields in classes.

- Static initializers are called, the first time a static object is referenced anywhere
  in the application.
- It's only called once, no matter how many references to that class which contains that
  static initializer,
- Static initializer will only be called the first time it's needed,

- Static initializers are great for:
  1. Initializing the values of "complex objects"
  2. Whenever you need to do any logical operations, including evaluating current
    state of the application before you assign the one and only value to the static object.
