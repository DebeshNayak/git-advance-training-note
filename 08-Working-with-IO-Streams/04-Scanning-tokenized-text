Scanning tokenized text:
- One of the most common cases in reading files is tokenized text.
- For example, comma delimited files where you get lines of text separated by
  commas, spaces, tabs, or other characters.
- Java has a class that handles this automatically called the scanner class.
- The scanner class can be used to easily read this sort of tokenized text, and
  it works well to read very large files, grab the text from those files already
  separated, and then process the text as needed in your application.
Example: 31-ScanningText
