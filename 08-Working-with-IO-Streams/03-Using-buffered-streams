Using buffered streams:
- When dealing with large text files, it's a good idea to wrap your FileReaders
  and FileWriters inside classes that will buffer the operations.
- Buffering the read and write operations is a good way of automatically managing
  memory so that you're efficiently putting content into memory and taking it out.
- It's a pretty simple operation. You can use the buffered reader and buffered writer
  classes wrapped around any instance of a reader or writer such as FileReader and FileWriter.
- You still get the advantages of internationalization with the FileReader and FileWriter,
  that is they'll adapt automatically to different character sets.
- With the buffered classes, you get improved memory management and a more efficient use of
  system resources.
