Reading and writing character streams:
- If you're working with character-based data, that is text files, it's recommended
  to use classes named FileReader and FileWriter instead of FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes.
- Because the FileReader and FileWriter automatically handle character sets other
  than UTF-8.
- To read and write text files, the FileReader and FileWriter are the best classes to do it.
  And they'll work whether you're working in Java 7 or in Android or previous versions of Java.

Example: 29-CharacterStream project
