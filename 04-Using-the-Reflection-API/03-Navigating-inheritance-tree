Navigating inheritance trees:
- Java greatly depends on the use of inheritance to manage the relationship between
  different classes.
- The Reflection API gives you tools that let you walk up the inheritance tree.
- Once you have an object that you have a reference to you can walk up to its super class and
  to its super class all the way up to the top level class object.
- You can always walk up the inheritance tree, but you can't easily walk down.
- We can find out the package of a class using Package class,
  which is a Class of java.lang package. And it is not a part of Reflection API.
- Reflection API has the following ability:
  - It has ability to interrogate existing objects,
  - Find out what their classes are
  - Find out about the inheritance tree.
  - What the super classes are
  - Find out where class is stored
