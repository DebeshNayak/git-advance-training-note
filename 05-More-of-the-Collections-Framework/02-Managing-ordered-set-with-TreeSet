Managing ordered set with TreeSet:
- The TreeSet implements everything the HashSet does,
- It also keeps everything in an order that you can control by implementing an interface called comparable
  in the class that you're storing.
- Each time an object is added to the TreeSet, the TreeSet will loop through all
  of its objects and resort them for you.
- This results in the TreeSet being slower than say the HashSet.
- So the comparison between HashSet and TreeSet:
  - HashSet is faster,
  - But the TreeSet lets you sort your data automatically as you add, remove, and otherwise organize your objects.
