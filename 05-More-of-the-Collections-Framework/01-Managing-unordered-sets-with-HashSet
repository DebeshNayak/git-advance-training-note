Managing unordered sets with HashSet:
------------------------------------
- Classes such as ArrayList and HashMap, which allow you to manage ordered and
  unordered sets of data.
- These classes are parts of something called the collections framework, a collection
  of classes that do different things with collections of data in your Java applications.
- All the classes of the Collection Framework are the classes of the java.util package.
-------------
HashSet: (highest performance and simplest of implementation)
- Now here's the thing about a set.
- Each of these objects can only be added to the set once,
  and if I try to add an object again it'll be ignored.
- The set can contain one reference to each object and one reference to null.
- Advantage: HashSet is that in comparison to say the TreeSet it's faster
- If all you need to do is to keep a set of objects in a collection, and you want
  to ensure that each object has only been added once, the HashSet is a great way to do it.
